## Build With üõ†

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android
  development.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Android‚Äôs
  modern toolkit for building native UI.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A coroutine is a
  concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes
  asynchronously.
- [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
  version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) -
  Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a
    state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
  - [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
    version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores
    UI-related data that isn"t destroyed on UI changes.
  - [Jetpack Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - The
    Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications.
  - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Jetpack
    DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects
    with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously,
    consistently, and transitionally.
- [Dagger-Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the     boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Doing manual dependency injection requires you to construct every class and its                 dependencies by hand, and to use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.
  
- [Splash API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) - Starting in Android 12, the SplashScreen API lets apps launch with animation, including an into-app motion at launch, a splash screen showing your app icon, and a transition to your app itself. A SplashScreen is a Window and therefore covers an Activity.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
  - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is
  primarily web-based.
